# starwars-game

It's a simple but poorly made game with javafx. Your objective is to reach yellow square before enemy characters catch up to you.

There are 2 playable characters: Luke and Yoda with only difference being that Yoda has 6 health instead of 3.

There are 3 enemy characters: Stormtrooper, KyloRen and DarthVader. Stormtrooper is standard character doesn't have any special ability. DarthVader can break the walls and KyloRen can move 2 spaces in one turn.
